USER PAGE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
============================

OVERVIEW
--------
Create a comprehensive user profile system with social features, allowing users to showcase their concert history, create posts, manage wishlists, and connect with other music fans.

COMPLETED FEATURES
------------------
- **User Model:** The `User` model in MongoDB has been extended to include fields for profile picture, banner image, bio, location, social links, followers, following, and concert lists (attended, wishlist, favorites).
- **User Profile Page:** The basic structure of the user profile page is in place, including a header, tabs for different content sections, and the main content area.
- **Fetch User Profile:** The frontend can fetch user profile data from the backend based on the username in the URL.
- **Follow/Unfollow:** The functionality to follow and unfollow users is implemented on both the frontend and backend.
- **Image Uploads:** Backend routes are set up for uploading profile pictures and banner images using Supabase storage.
- **Concert Lists:** Backend routes are available to add and remove concerts from a user's attended, wishlist, and favorites lists.
- **API Routes:** All the necessary API routes for user profiles, concert management, and social features have been created.

COMPLETED PHASES
================

PHASE 1: Fix Concert Review Display Issue ✅
-----------------------------------------
**Problem:** Reviews weren't displaying when opening concert cards from attended page.
**Solution:** Updated ConcertModal.jsx to use `event.seatgeekId` instead of `event.id`.

PHASE 2: Add Concert to Lists from Catalog ✅
------------------------------------------
**Problem:** Users couldn't add concerts to lists from catalog.
**Solution:** 
- Fixed ID handling between MongoDB and SeatGeek
- Created new endpoint to save individual events
- Fixed data flow from catalog to user lists

PHASE 3: Improve Catalog UX and Concert Filtering ✅
-------------------------------------------------
**Implemented:**
- Loading overlay with "Adding..." message
- Page refresh after successful addition
- Date-based filtering (wishlist=future, attended/favorites=past)
- Toast notifications instead of browser alerts
- Confirmation dialog for removing concerts
- Trash icon with better styling for remove buttons

PHASE 4: Wishlist Concert Adding Fix ✅
-------------------------------------
**Problem:** Couldn't add upcoming concerts to wishlist.
**Solution:** 
- Created `/api/events/save` endpoint to save concerts before adding to lists
- Fixed data transformation in CatalogModal
- Better error handling for missing concert data
