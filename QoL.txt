1. When a user uses the search bar, they should not be able to search up themselves

2. When the user tries to delete a post, they get a confirmation, which is good. the issue is that it is a broswer notification and not a nice UI like a toast notification. 

3. Users cannot currenly upload photos with posts. Do I need to create a bucket for this in supabase? If so, let me know what bucket and what permissions I have to enable.
