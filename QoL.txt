1. Change sucess color to lavendar in order to be consistent with color scheme
    - also the notifications in general kind of look ugly and they have two x buttons for whatever reason

    I think the best way to handle this is to not do any notifications for a sucessfulyl adeded concert and only do notifications for errors. try different 
    design choice to make the errors look better. but make sure it is consistent with what the website is going for.

2. There needs to be an automatic reload once a user removes a concert, so that the view is immeaditely updated

3. also the search bar in the catalog view does not work properly. For exmaple, when I search up "Burna Boy" in the wishlist, he does not show up even though I know he has many upcoming
concerts 

4.The handling for a user uploading a profile picture exists, but there is no actual upload a profile picture present on the user page.
