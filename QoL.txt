1. Once users leave a review, the review options at the top should no longer be present. There are already in line tools that let them update or delete their review
 - they can have the option to leave a a review again once they have deleted

 2. At the moment, a user gets a notification that something failed to upload, there are 2 X's that appear. One on the left and one on the right. Design wise, I don't like the way it looks. Theere should be no X's
    simply, a pop up should come up that there was a failure to uplaod an image/profile picture and it should disspear on its own relatively quickly

3. when a user fails to leave or update a review, they get a wanring in their browswer as a popup.  which is unhelpful
    when a user fails to leave a review and it is the fault of the server. It should say review failed to submit: server issue. and not in the browser pop up. It should be a nice UI element. 
    when a user fails to leave a review an artist, there should be an inline error saying already reviewed although if the first issue is addressed, this one should no longer be an issue.
    
    
After these issues are dealt with, posts can finally be developed
