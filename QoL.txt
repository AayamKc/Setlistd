 Users cannot currenly upload photos with posts. Do I need to create a bucket for this in supabase? If so, let me know what bucket and what permissions I have to enable.

**Solution**:
- **Supabase Bucket Setup**: Create a bucket named `post-images` with:
  - Public bucket: Yes (for easy image access via URLs)
  - Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`
  - Max file size: 5MB per image
  - File name template: `{userId}/{timestamp}-{random}.{extension}`
  - Enable RLS policies for authenticated users to upload/delete their own images
- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Update Post model: Add `images: [{ type: String }]` field to store image URLs
  - Modify `CreatePostModal` to include image upload UI with drag-and-drop
  - Support up to 4 images per post with preview functionality
  - Add image compression client-side before upload (target: < 1MB)
  - Update post display components to show image gallery
  - Handle image cleanup when posts are deleted
